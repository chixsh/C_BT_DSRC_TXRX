ThE routine fnComputeOffsetPointUsingHeadingLatLong generates the lat and long of a point that is 
offset from a reference point on a vehicle.

THE ORIGIN OF THE REFERENCE SYSTEM IS THE GPS ANTENNA THAT IS USED FOR GETTING THE GPS DATA STREAM.

The X-Axis of the reference system for specifying the offset, is in the horizontal plane, passes through the reference point with positive being towards the front of the vehicle. The Y-Axis is also in the horizontal plane, passes through the reference point and has the left of the vehicle as the +ve direction. The Z-Axis is Vertical with up direction being +ve

The track of the vehicle is assumed to be along the X-Axis. 

The assumption is NOT valid:
		In a skid. (The yaw angle must be estimated.)
		When reversing. (The vehicle is moving along the -ve X-Axis

The above two conditions will require the code below to be wrappered.

The computation uses lat long and does not transform to ECEF cordinates
